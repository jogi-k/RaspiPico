# RaspiPico
Snippets and info for Raspberry Pi Pico

## Micro-Python

* when having installed Micro-Python, store your programm as main.py on the Pico and it will be autostarted on power
* The necessary Firmware/Python-Interpreter you need to download from either Raspberry or from e.g Pimoroni (with additional libs..)
* These Firmwwares are on my local drive available in Directory : PythonInterpreter , but this is ignored for git !

## SDK

In this repository are also expamples based on the SDK-usage

You need to install for that SDK from raspberry-pi like described in :  
https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf

You might also want to download the examples from Raspberry-PI foundation for the PICO, as well as the additional examples and tools from Pimoroni for the PICO

For me (Jogi) on my Drive they are also in here in the subdirectories :

* pico-examples  (From Raspberry-PI)
* pimoroni-pico  (From Pimoroni)

These 2 directories are not part of my github-repo, they are in the .gitignore-file
Set these up according to  : https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/blob/main/setting-up-the-pico-sdk.md
